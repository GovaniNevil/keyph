                            <p className='mb-4'>An on-grid solar system, also known as a	grid-tied solar system, is the most widely deployed form of rooftop solar across the world. These systems do not need any batteries and are connected to the utility grid power.</p>
                            <p className='mb-4'>It is best suited for customers with stable grid power and minimal power cuts. Other than homes, even educational institutions, industrial units, commercial establishments use these systems as their primary source of power.
                            </p>
                            <p className='mb-4'>An on-grid system is designed to first allow solar energy to be consumed by the customer. Beyond this, if the customer needs any excess power, it is drawn from the grid. If the customer’s energy requirement is lower than power generated from the solar system, excess solar units are exported to the grid. This is possible through a “Net-meter”. The Net meter is provided by the electricity board, Net meter calculates how many units has your solar system generated and transmitted to the electricity board and  also how many units have been consumed from the electricity board. Mandatory requirements are the  need to check the sanction load mentioned on the electricity bill , get feasibility certificate & net Metering permission from the electricity board.</p>

                            <p className='mb-4'>In an off-grid solar system the electricity generated from the panels is transmitted from the Solar Inverter to the appliances at your home and also towards the battery . The energy stored in the battery is used during night. This runs independently from/off the power grid and hence does not  require any permission from the electricity board.
                            </p>
                            <p className='mb-4'>The cost of an off-grid solar system has an even wider range because there are a variety of sizes, applications, and components that impact the price.

                            </p>
                            <p className='mb-4'>An alternative to off-grid solar systems is a hybrid system, which remains tied to the grid but includes a solar battery bank to store excess energy.

                            <p className='mb-4'>A Hybrid Solar System contains solar panels, a Solar	hybrid inverter, and battery storage to create an uninterrupted energy solution. </p>
                            <p className='mb-4'>The functionality of this system starts from a  Solar Hybrid Panel that helps to capture the sunlight and then convert it into DC (Direct Current) electricity. The DC electricity from the Solar Hybrid Panel is converted into AC (Alternating Current) with the help of an Solar  Hybrid  Inverter. Solar Hybrid Inverter is connected with Net-Meter as well as with Batteries or Diesel Engine .Then the excess solar energy produced during the day is stored in a Battery Storage for use at night or on cloudy days for a continuous electricity supply. These systems combine the best features of grid-tied and off-grid solar systems, ensuring continuous solar power operation. When solar and battery energy are insufficient, then Grid Connection draws power from the grid and also exports excess energy to the grid. This way Hybrid Solar Systems gives you double benefit ie. Reduction of electricity bill and 24 hours power connectivity.
